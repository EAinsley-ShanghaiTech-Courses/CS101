\question{4}{(4') DFS went wrong!}
The following algorithm which runs DFS on a directed graph, but it contains an fatal error.
\begin{lstlisting}
    Create a stack.
    Choose the initial vertex and mark it as visited.
    Put the initial vertex onto the stack.
    while the stack is not empty:
        Pop a vertex V from the top of the stack.
        for each neighbor of V:
            if that neighbor is not marked as visited:
                Mark that neighbor as visited.
                Push that neighbor onto the stack.
\end{lstlisting}

Please give a graph as an counterexample and briefly explain why this algorithm is wrong.
\\
\textit{Note: In this problem, we say a node is "visited" whenever it is marked as visited.}\\
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{scope}[every node/.style={circle, thick, draw}]
			\node(A) at (0, 0) {A};
			\node(B) at (-2, -2){B};
			\node(C) at (0, -2) {C};
			\node(D) at (2, -2) {D};
		\end{scope}
		\begin{scope}[>={Stealth[black]}, every edge/.style={draw=black,thick}]
			\path [->] (A) edge (B);
			\path [->] (A) edge (C);
			\path [->] (A) edge (D);
			\path [->] (B) edge[bend right=60] (D);
		\end{scope}
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
In the above graph, the correct DFS order (preorder) from node $A$ should be $A, B, D, C$, or $A, C, B, D$, or $A, C, D, B$, or $A, D, B, C$, or $A, D, C, B$. However, the algorithm above will give $A, B, C, D$,or $A, B, D, C$ or $A, C, B, D$, or $A, C, D, B$, or $A, D, B, C$, or $A, D, C, B$. The order $A, B, C, D$ is wrong.This is because $D$ is marked as visited while it actually haven't been visited. The problem of the algorithm is that the vertex should be marked as visited when poped, not pushed. It can be modified as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}
	Create a stack.
	Choose the initial vertex and mark it as visited.
	Put the initial vertex onto the stack.
	while the stack is not empty:
			Pop a vertex V from the top of the stack.
			if V is not marked as visited:
					Mark V as visited.
			for each neighbor of V:
					if that neighbor is not marked as visited:
							Push that neighbor onto the stack.
\end{lstlisting}

\question{5}{(2'+3') Bipartite graph}

A bipartite graph, $G = (V,E)$, is a graph such that V can be partitioned into two subsets $V_1$ and $V_2$
and no edge has both its vertices in the same subset. See the figure below.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{bipartite_graph.png}
	\label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

(a) Show that every tree is a bipartite graph.\\
\\
Firstly, put root into $V_1$. For each node in the tree, if its parent is in $V_1$, put the node into $V_2$, else put the node into $V_1$. Since each node are connected noly to its parent and children, the previous construction method, each node are in the different set to its parent and children, it doesn't connect to any other node in the same set. Therefore, each tree is a bipartite graph.\\
\\
(b) The bipartite matching problem is to find the largest subset $E'$ of $E$ such that no vertex is
included in more than one edge. A matching of four edges (indicated by dashed edges) as
\\
Suppose now you have the solution of bipartite matching problem, let's call it algorithm $A$. Show how the bipartite matching problem can be used to solve the following problem: We have
a set of workers, a set of tasks, and a list of tasks that each worker is qualified to finish.
If no worker is required to finish more than one task, and each worker can only finish his qualified tasks, what is the maximum number of tasks that can be finished?\\
(You just need to show how to construct this problem as one bipartite matching problem, and do not need to give the detail of algorithm $A$.)\\
\\
We see both workers and tasks as vertices in the graph. If a worker is qualified to finish the task according to the list, the worker vertex and the task vertex are connected. Since no connection among workers, nor among tasks, the graph is a bipartite graph $G(V, E)$ with worker vertices been put into $V_1$ and task vertices been put into $V_2$. The degree of the worker vertices indicates the number of tasks the worker is going to finish and the degree of the task vertex indicates the how many times it is to be finished. No worker is required to finish more than one task, and no task need to be finished more than once (of course). Therefore, no vertex is included in more than one edge.(*) We want to find the maximum number of tasks that can be finished means we want to find the largest subsets of $E$ meets the previous constraint (*). This is a bipartite matching problem.\\
